# History

## Project Context
- **Project:** Strategic Research Initiative — AI + .NET Opportunities
- **User:** Bruno Capuano (Developer Advocate, Microsoft Cloud & GitHub Technologies)
- **Goal:** Identify high-impact opportunities at AI + .NET intersection → NuGet packages, OSS samples, complementary libraries
- **Stack:** Research & analysis focused on .NET ecosystem, Microsoft Azure, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Foundry

## Learnings

### Trend Analysis (2025)
**Key Trends Identified:**
1. **Agent Frameworks**: Multi-agent collaboration, state machines (LangGraph), production features gaining dominance. .NET needs visual workflow design + multi-agent coordination.
2. **AI Observability**: Braintrust, Phoenix, LangSmith leading. .NET lacks native evaluation/tracing frameworks—major gap.
3. **Local Deployment**: Ollama/LM Studio/LocalAI trending for privacy/cost. .NET needs native clients + enterprise templates.
4. **Structured Output**: Constrained decoding now standard (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). .NET needs schema-enforcement library—foundational capability.
5. **AI-Native Testing**: DeepEval-style frameworks, synthetic data, LLM-as-Judge critical for production. .NET has zero native solutions.
6. **Prompt Management**: PromptLayer/Langfuse/LangSmith models. .NET needs versioning + Azure-integrated solution.
7. **Model Routing**: Portkey/LiteLLM gateways for multi-provider strategies. .NET needs native gateway + YARP integration.
8. **App Templates**: Python/Node.js dominate starter kits. .NET needs comprehensive Azure-integrated templates.

**Strategic Insight:** Python leads research/prototyping, but .NET can dominate production deployment via enterprise strengths (Azure, performance, security, type safety). Focus on production tooling, not research parity.

**Highest Priority Opportunities:**
- Structured output library (universal need)
- LLM testing framework (mandatory for production)
- Observability toolkit (every app needs it)
- Model gateway library (multi-provider becoming standard)
- Azure AI Templates (lower barrier to entry)

**Competitive Moat:** Azure integration, enterprise patterns, production-grade tooling where .NET naturally excels.
