# Orchestration Log: Byers CI/CD Workflow
**Agent:** Byers (Senior .NET Developer)  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24T16:32:00Z  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Task:** Create GitHub Actions workflow for MkDocs deployment

## Task Execution

### Objectives
- Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated MkDocs build and deploy
- Configure GitHub Pages publishing
- Ensure docs publish on push to main branch

### Deliverables Created

1. **.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml**
   - Trigger: push to main branch (paths: docs/**, mkdocs.yml, requirements.txt)
   - Jobs: install dependencies, build site, deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact, actions/deploy-pages
   - Permissions: id-token write, pages write

### Configuration Details
- Checkout with depth: 0 (full history for git operations)
- Python 3.11 environment
- Dependencies installed via: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Build command: `mkdocs build`
- Artifact path: site/ (MkDocs build output)
- GitHub Pages deployment with environment: github-pages

### Quality Checks
- Workflow syntax valid (GitHub Actions schema)
- Conditional build triggers prevent unnecessary runs
- Permissions follow least-privilege principle
- Artifact retention follows GitHub Pages defaults

## Decision Log
**Decision:** Use GitHub Actions native deployment (actions/deploy-pages)  
**Rationale:** Native integration, automatic HTTPS, custom domain support, zero infrastructure  
**Impact:** MkDocs site auto-publishes on every push to main; no manual deployment needed

## Dependencies & Handoffs
- Depends on: Frohike's mkdocs.yml and requirements.txt
- Requires: GitHub Pages enabled in repo settings (branch: gh-pages)
- Next step: Coordinator verifies build succeeds

## Files Modified
- Created: .github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml
